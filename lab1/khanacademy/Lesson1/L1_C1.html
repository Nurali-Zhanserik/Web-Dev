    <h1>Between the lines </h1>
    <p>I chase the quiet between each thought, <br>
Where doubts dissolve and fears are caught. <br>
The world grows still, the noise turns thin, <br>
And something brighter hums within. <br>
 <br>
I stumble, sure—but still I stand, <br>
With open eyes and shaking hand. <br>
Each step I take, though small, is mine, <br>
A crooked path toward a distant shine. <br>
 <br>
If storms arrive and shadows stay, <br>
I’ll learn their language, not run away. <br>
For even night, when held just right, <br>
Is only practice for the light.</p>
