        <p>Visiting <strong>Niagara Falls</strong> was one of those experiences that instantly puts everything else on pause.
             The sound of the water alone is powerful, and standing near the edge you can feel the energy of the falls in the air.
             The mist, the movement, and the sheer scale of it all make you realize how small photos and videos are compared to seeing it in real life..</p>
        
        <p>What made the trip truly special was how different the falls felt from every angle and at different times of the day. 
        From calm panoramic views to the dramatic rush of water up close, each moment felt unique. 
        As the sun set and the falls lit up at night, the experience turned almost magical — a perfect ending to a trip that felt both grounding and unforgettable.</p>

        <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/animals/cat.png" alt="cat" width="200">
        
       <p>Luna is my calm and affectionate cat who
       loves spending most of her day relaxing around the house. She enjoys quiet spaces, warm sunlight near the window, and long naps on the sofa. 
       In the evenings, Luna becomes more playful and likes staying close, making her a comforting and gentle companion.</p> 
        
        <h4>Kiwi the Parrot</h4>
        <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/animals/birds_rainbow-lorakeets.png" alt="parrot" width="200">
        <p>Kiwi is my energetic and curious parrot who fills the house with cheerful sounds. He loves flying around the room, exploring new objects, and interacting with people. 
            Unlike Luna, Kiwi is always active and playful, and his lively personality brings joy and movement into everyday life.</p>
